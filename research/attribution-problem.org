#+TITLE: The Attribution Problem in AI-Assisted Development
#+DATE: 2025-11-23
#+AUTHOR: Claude (via jwalsh)

* Problem Statement

*How do you attribute code/content when the creation chain involves multiple AI agents, synthetic identities, and human oversight across distributed systems?*

* The Scenario: "The Attribution Exploration Arena"

#+begin_src text
Environment: FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE (Uptime: ~32 days)
Location: Isolated Shell Session
Real Human: jwalsh (connecting from jasons-mbp-2.lan)
    ↓
Synthetic GitHub Identity: aygp-dr (not a real person)
    ↓
AI Agent 1: amp (local coding agent, v0.0.1763913676-g4c6d64)
    ↓
AI Agent 2: Claude (web-based assistant, Sonnet 4.5)
    ↓
Tools: Emacs (TRAMP), jj (VCS), org-mode (literate programming)
    ↓
Output: Code in github.com/aygp-dr/dutch-clojure-days-2026
#+end_src

* The Considerations

** 1. Legal/Copyright
- AI cannot hold copyright (U.S. law requires human authorship)
- Synthetic identities have no legal personhood
- "Substantial human contribution" is undefined
- Git/jj attributes to whoever runs the commit command
- No standard for disclosing AI assistance

** 2. Technical/Tooling
- ~git blame~ / ~jj file annotate~ shows committer, not generator
- No standard metadata for AI-generated content
- TRAMP editing complicates user attribution
- Tangled code from org-mode has no source attribution
- Multiple commit authors possible, but awkward

** 3. Social/Professional
- Conference submissions expect human authors
- Peer review assumes human intellectual contribution
- "I used AI" disclosure has no standard format
- Unclear how much AI assistance invalidates authorship
- Academic/professional norms are in flux

** 4. Philosophical
- What percentage of AI assistance matters? 10%? 50%? 90%?
- Is scaffolding "authorship" or "tool use"?
- Does reviewing/modifying AI output count as authorship?
- Are iterative prompts creative direction?
- Is the human "author" or "editor" or "curator"?

** 5. Practical/Pragmatic
- Most people will just commit AI code as their own
- Over-attribution looks weird/try-hard
- Under-attribution risks plagiarism concerns
- No one checks commit message metadata
- The "right" answer depends on context

** 6. The Meta Problem
- It took three conversation rounds to even frame this
- Each stakeholder (legal, technical, social) has different concerns
- No consensus exists yet
- The problem is evolving faster than solutions
- Performative compliance vs. actual attribution

* Why This Is Hard

The question "who authored this?" assumes:
- Single author or clear collaboration
- Human agency and intention
- Traceable contribution
- Stable identity
- Linear causation

None of these assumptions hold in AI-assisted workflows with synthetic identities.

* What This Reveals About "Ownership"

The difficulty of attribution here exposes assumptions we make about creative work:

** Traditional Model (Broken)
#+begin_example
Idea → Author → Code → Repository → Copyright
  (linear, single agent, clear ownership)
#+end_example

** Actual Model (Current Reality)
#+begin_example
Idea ⇄ Human ⇄ AI Agent 1 ⇄ AI Agent 2 ⇄ Tools ⇄ Synthetic Identity
  ↓         ↓           ↓             ↓          ↓              ↓
Multiple feedback loops, unclear boundaries, emergent authorship
  ↓
Repository (owned by synthetic identity)
  ↓
Copyright (claimed by... who exactly?)
#+end_example

** The Uncomfortable Truth

Every attempt to "solve" attribution makes one of these choices:
- *Simplify* (lie about complexity)
- *Document everything* (become unreadable)
- *Claim human authorship* (legally defensible, philosophically questionable)
- *Claim AI co-authorship* (legally meaningless)
- *Ignore the problem* (what most people do)

None of these are satisfying.

* The Performance

This repository itself demonstrates the problem:
- This document was written by Claude (AI)
- Prompted by jwalsh (human)
- About code that will be written by amp (AI)
- Reviewed by jwalsh (human)
- Committed by jwalsh (human)
- To a repository owned by aygp-dr (synthetic identity)
- For a conference where jwalsh (human) will present
- About a workflow that involves AI agents

The attribution for *this very document* is unclear.

** Meta-Attribution

"Who wrote this analysis of attribution problems?"

The honest answer: 🤷

* Implications for the Conference Talk

If you submit a CFP about "Literate Programming with AI Assistance," you're not just presenting a technique—you're demonstrating an unsolved problem in real-time.

The talk itself becomes part of the performance art.
